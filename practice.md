# Practice Problems 

It is easy for non-obvious bugs to EASILY work their way into your code. Once you see the problem, it will seem obvious. But until you see it the code often looks fine and itâ€™s unclear why it is not working as expected.

These practice problems are largely an opportunity to review content from CPP 526 and develop a sensitivity to the nuances of R. It also demonstrates the importance of testing your code for unexpected behaviors and writing robust and maintainable scripts.

These questions are similar to riddles or brain teasers that help sharpen your critical thinking skills when working with code. Work through each on your own, then discuss solutions on YellowDig with classmates.

You can start working on the practice problems at any time but please don't post solutions until after lab due dates so that there is sufficient time for discussions on questions from the previous week. 
  
Each question should have it's own pin. Please group responses to one question on one pin and avoid creating new pins when the question already exists.
