<p>Lab 04 introduces the tools of string operators and <strong>regular expressions</strong> that enable rich text analysis in R. They are important functions for cleaning data in large datasets, generating new variables, and qualitative analysis of text-based databases using tools like content analysis, sentiment analysis, and natural language processing libraries.</p>
<p>The data for the lab comes from IRS archives of 1023-EZ applications that nonprofits submit when they are filing for tax-exempt status. We will use mission statements, organizational names, and activity codes.</p>
<p>The lab consists of three parts. Part I is a warm-up that asks you to construct a few regular expressions to identify specific patterns in the mission text.</p>
<p>Part II asks you to use the <strong>quanteda</strong> package, a popular text analysis package in R, to perform a simple content analysis by counting the most frequently-used words in the mission statements.</p>
<p>Part III asks you to use text functions and regular expressions to search mission statements to develop a sample of specific nonprofits using keywords and phrases.</p>

<p>You need to search for the following patterns below, print the first six missions that meet the criteria, and report a total count of missions that meet the criteria.</p>
<p>You will use <strong>grep()</strong> and <strong>grepl()</strong>. The <strong>grep()</strong> function will find missions that match the criteria and return the full string. <strong>grepl()</strong> is the logical version of <strong>grep()</strong>, so it returns a vector of TRUE or FALSE, with TRUE representing the cases that match the specified criteria.</p>
<pre><code>grep(  pattern=&quot;some.reg.ex&quot;, x=&quot;mission statements&quot;, value=TRUE )</code></pre>

<h2>Part II</h2>
<p>Perform a very basic content analysis with the mission text. Report the ten most frequently-used words in mission statements. Exclude punctuation, and “stem” the words.</p>
<p>You will be using the <a href="https://quanteda.io/">quanteda</a> package in R for the language processing functions. It is an extremely powerful tool that integrates with a variety of natural language processing tools, qualitative analysis packages, and machine learning frameworks for predictive analytics using text inputs.</p>
<p>In general, languages and thus text are semi-structured data sources. There are patterns and rules to languages, but rules are less rigid and patterns can be more subtle (computers are much better at picking out patterns in language use from large amounts of text than humans are). As a result of the nature of text as data, you will find that the cleaning, processing, and preparation steps can be more intensive than quantitative data. They are designed to filter out large portions of text that hold sentences together and create subtle meaning in context, but offer little in terms of general pattern recognition. Eliminating capitalization and punctuation help simplify the text. Paragraphs and sentences are atomized into lists of words. And things like stemming or converting multiple words to single compound words (e.g. White House to white_house) help reduce the complexity of the text.</p>
<p>The short tutorial below is meant to introduce you to a few functions that can be useful for initiating analysis with text and introduce you to common pre-processing steps.</p>
<p>Note that in the field of literature we refer to an author’s or a field’s body of work. In text analysis, we refer to a database of text-based documents as a “corpus” (Latin for <em>body</em>). Each document has text, which is the unit of analysis. But it also has meta-data that is useful for making sense of the text and identifying patterns. Common meta-data might be things like year of publication, author, type of document (newspaper article, tweet, email, spoken speech, etc.). The <strong>corpus()</strong> function primarily serves to make the text database easy to use by keeping the text and meta-data connected and simpatico during pre-processing steps.</p>
<p>Typically large texts are broken into smaller parts, or “tokenized”. Paragraphs can be split into sentences, sentences split into words. In regression we pay attention to correlations between numbers - when one variable X is increasing, is another variable Y also increasing, decreasing, or not covarying with X? In text analysis the analogous operation is co-occurrence. How often do words co-occur in sentences or documents? Or do we expect them to co-occur more frequently than they actually do given their frequency in the corpus (the equivalent of two words being negatively correlated). It is through tokenization that these relationships can be established.</p>
<p>In the example below we will split missions into sets of words, apply a “dictionary” or “thesaurus” to join multiple words that describe a single concept (e.g. New York City), stem the words to standardize them as much as possible, then conduct the simplest type of content analysis possible - count word frequency.</p>

<h3>Stemming</h3>
<p>Many words have a stem that is altered when conjugated (if a verb) or made pluran (if a noun). As a result, it can be hard to consistently count the appearance of specific word.</p>
<p>Stemming removes the last part of the word such that the word is reduced to it’s most basic stem. For example, <em>running</em> would become <em>run</em>, and <em>Tuesdays</em> would become <em>Tuesday</em>.</p>
<p>Quanteda already has a powerful stemming function included.</p>

<h2>Part III</h2>
<p>For the last part of this lab, you will use text to classify nonprofits.</p>
<p>A large foundation is interested in knowing how many new nonprofits created in 2018 have an explicit mission of serving minority communities. We will start by trying to identify nonprofits that are membership organizations for Black communities or provide services to Black communities.</p>
<p>To do this, you will create a set of words or phrases that you believe indicates that the nonprofit works with or for the target population.</p>
<p>You will need to think about different ways that language might be used distinctively within the mission statements of nonprofit that serve Black communities. There is a lot of trial and error involved, as you can test several words and phrases, preview the mission statements that are identified, then refine your methods.</p>
<p>Your final product will be a data frame of the nonprofit names, activity codes, and mission statements for the organizations identified by your criteria. The goal is to identify as many as possible while minimizing errors that occur when you include a nonprofit that does not serve the Black community. This example was selected specifically because “black” is a common and ambiguous term.</p>
<p>To get you started, let’s look at a similar example where we want to identify immigrants rights nonprofits. We would begin as follows:</p>

<p>After you feel comfortable that individual statements are primarily identifying nonprofits within your desired group and have low error rates, you will need to combine all of the criteria to create one group. Note that any organization that has more than one keyword or phrase in it’s mission statement would be double-counted if you use the raw groups, so we need to make sure we include each organizaton only once. We can do this using compound logical statements.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>grepl()</strong> returns a logical vector, so we can combine multiple statements using AND and OR conditions.</p>

<p>Note that to select all high school boys you would write:</p>

<p>You would NOT specify:</p>
<pre><code>( grade_9 | grade_10 | grade_11 | grade_12 ) | boys </code></pre>

<p>For your deliverables for Part III:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Report the total count of organizations you have identified as serving Black communities.<br />
</li>
<li>Take a random sample of 20 of the organizations in your sample and verify that your search criteria are identifying nonprofits that serve Black communities. Report your rate of false positives.</li>
<li>Similar to the immigrant example, print a data frame that contains the nonprofit names, activity codes (see above on how to combine them), and their mission statements. Print the full data frame for your sample so all mission are visible.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Challenge Question</h1>
<p>If you selected three nonprofit subsectors from the activity codes (<em>code01</em>), then created three data subsets based upon these criteria you could conduct something like content analysis as a way to compare how the three groups use language difference.</p>
<div id="part-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 1:</h2>
<p>Re-run the content analysis to identify the most frequently-used words. But this time run it separately for each subsector.</p>
<p>How do the most frequently used words vary by subsector? Which words are shared between the three subsectors? Which are distinct?</p>
</div>
<div id="part-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Part 2:</h2>
<p>Another way to compare differences in language use is by creating semantic networks:</p>
<p><a href="https://nonprofit-open-data-collective.github.io/machine_learning_mission_codes/tutorials/semantic_networks.html">TUTORIAL</a></p>
<p>Compare prominent word relationships in mission statements of arts, environmental, and education nonprofits (<em>codedef01</em>). Build semantic networks for each, then compare and contrast the prominence of specific words within the networks.</p>

<h1>Submission Instructions</h1>
<p>When you have completed your assignment, knit your RMD file to generate your rendered HTML file.</p>
<p>Login to Canvas at <a href="http://canvas.asu.edu" class="uri">http://canvas.asu.edu</a> and navigate to the assignments tab in the course repository. Upload your HTML and RMD files to the appropriate lab submission link.</p>
<p>Remember to:</p>
<ul>
<li>name your files according to the convention: <strong>Lab-##-LastName.Rmd</strong></li>
<li>show your solution, include your code.</li>
<li>do not print excessive output (like a full data set).</li>
<li>follow appropriate style guidelines (spaces between arguments, etc.).</li>

<div id="notes-on-knitting" class="section level2">
<h2>Notes on Knitting</h2>
<p>Note that when you knit a file, it starts from a blank slate. You might have packages loaded or datasets active on your local machine, so you can run code chunks fine. But when you knit you might get errors that functions cannot be located or datasets don’t exist. Be sure that you have included chunks to load these in your RMD file.</p>
<p>Your RMD file will not knit if you have errors in your code. If you get stuck on a question, just add <code>eval=F</code> to the code chunk and it will be ignored when you knit your file. That way I can give you credit for attempting the question and provide guidance on fixing the problem.</p>
