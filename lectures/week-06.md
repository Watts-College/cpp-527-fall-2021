## What is a Template?

Solid data programming skills are needed to generate robust results. Accuracy is necessary but not sufficient to achieve impact with your work. You also need to be effective at communicating your results in a clear and concise manner.
   
Templates are ways to separate **content** (or data) from **design** (page layout, fonts, styles, spacing). 
  
You have already encountered a couple of template examples including: 

* Jekyll templates like the [table example using liquid tags and YAML headers](http://ds4ps.org/barebones-jekyll/page2)  
* An HTML page template like the [syllabus page for this course](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Watts-College/cpp-527-fall-2021/main/_layouts/index.html)  
  
This week you will learn how to build templates for R Markdown documents so that you can automate reporting systems (for example, create the same report each week with new data) or batch process a large number of reports using different slices of the data for each (for example, produce a separate crime report for each city in a US database).

*If you want to take your skills to the next level consider how report templates can be used to implement experiments with the presentation of information such as [A/B Testing for your resume](https://davidlindelof.com/a-b-testing-my-resume/). These sorts of skills are in high-demand as they are useful for refining content for large-scale marketing campaigns, outreach material, or user experience on a website.*
